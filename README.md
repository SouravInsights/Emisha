## __ABOUT US__
> Emisha" is a non-profit tech community, that runs Free workshops, Special events, Seminars, Hackathon, Coding competitions etc. It also offers valuable leadership experiences, connections to professional organizations, networking opportunities, and special events that mold a student’s perspective and power of virtualization– during the college years and beyond. Our comunity is open to everyone who has a williingness to learn and passionate about tech. We also welcome those students who don't even belong to computer science so that can be a part of diverse network. 
## __OUR MISSION__
>Our community's primary goal is to spread the computer education awareness through out every Regional schools and help students in rural areas of Odisha to gain a strong knowledge in Computers. We're trying to reach our to the unreached parts of odisha. Women participation in the tech activities is slightly inclined but recently due to Women Techmakers Group, they are showing more interest. The ratio is still very low but we expect it'll grow in near future. We want to host more frequent talks, events to get everyone involved in tech related activities.
## __OUR PLAN__
> We will measure success based on the number of people who show up during each workshop. We might also ask them to fill out surveys to see how they feel about the event. The frequency of iterating the community plans will depend on how many people show up to the workshops. If the workshops attract a good number of audience, we'll plan to organize a big hackathon for interested students.
